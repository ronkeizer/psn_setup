PsN scripted setup
==================

This is an adaptation of the original PsN (http://psn.sourceforge.net)
setup script to facilitate scripted installation, e.g. when using Chef, 
Ansible, Vagrant, or shell scripts.  Note that it accepts all PsN defaults, 
assumes all Perl dependencies are installed, and does not copy documentation.

The script is adapted from PsN version 4.2.0, but may work for
older/newer versions. Use at your own risk.
